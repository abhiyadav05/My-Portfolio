                    <h2>HTML Learn</h2>
                    <p class="lh-1">HyperText Markup Language (HTML) is a type of markup language.[1] It is used to make
                        webpages. Webpages can include writing, links, pictures, and even sound and video. HTML tells
                        web browsers what webpages should look like. HTML also adds meta information to webpages. Meta
                        information is information about about a webpage e.g., the name of the person who created the
                        page. Web browsers usually do not show meta information. </p>
                    <p class="lh-sm">HTML is often used with Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and JavaScript. CSS is used to
                        change the way HTML looks. JavaScript tells websites how to behave. It can also change HTML and
                        CSS. </p>
                    <p class="lh-base">HTML uses "elements" to let the browser know how a webpage is made of. Elements
                        are shown as "tags" in the code, written with angle brackets: <example>. Tags usually come in
                            pairs: an opening tag defines the start of a block of content and a closing tag defines the
                            end of that block of content. There are many kinds of tags, and each one has a different
                            purpose. See Basic HTML Tags below for tag examples.</p>
                    <p class="lh-lg">This is a long paragraph written to show how the line-height of an element is
                        affected by our utilities. Classes are applied to the element itself or sometimes the parent
                        element. These classes can be customized as needed with our utility API.</p>

                    <h2>CSS Learn</h2>
                    <p class="text-decoration-underline">Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for
                        describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML or XML
                        (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML).[1] CSS is a cornerstone technology of the
                        World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.</p>
                    <p class="text-decoration-line-through">CSS is designed to enable the separation of content and
                        presentation, including layout, colors, and fonts.[3] This separation can improve content
                        accessibility; provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation
                        characteristics; enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in
                        a separate .</p>
                    <a href="#" class="text-decoration-none">The CSS specifications are maintained by the World Wide Web
                        Consortium (W3C). Internet media type (MIME type) text/css is registered for use with CSS by RFC
                        2318 (March 1998). The W3C operates a free CSS validation service for CSS documents.</a>

                    <h2>Javascript Learn</h2>

                    <p class="text-decoration-underline">JavaScript is a high-level programming language that follows
                        the ECMAScript standard. It was originally designed as a scripting language for websites but
                        became widely adopted as a general-purpose programming language, and is currently the most
                        popular programming language in use.[1] JavaScript is usually found running in a web browser as
                        interactive or automated content, ranging from popup messages and live clocks to large web
                        applications. </p>
                    <p class="text-decoration-line-through">JavaScript is also commonly used in server-side programming
                        through platforms like Node.js,[2] or "embedded" in non-JavaScript applications where the base
                        programming language lacks the high-level functionality that JavaScript offers. </p>
                    <a href="#" class="text-decoration-none">JavaScript is typically inserted into HTML when used on the
                        web, either directly in the file in an HTML tag, or linked to a separate file containing the
                        script.

                        JavaScript, as a full featured scripting language, can be used to provide functionality to a
                        website.</a>
